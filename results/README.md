# wasp-kiwi
This directory contains the containers developed during the WASP SC of 2018.

## Project description
The purpose of the project was to develop a control system enabling a KIWI car
to follow a leader at a fixed distance based on taken images and ultrasonic
distance measurements. In groups of two, students were given some flexibility
in defining both the problem and the solution, with many ending up using OpenCV
with simpler P or PD controllers. However, as the found solutions differed between
the groups, the repository is structured in a set of 11 directories named `/groupX`,
each containing the source code developed by the corresponding group and a
short description of the solutions.
